Summary: Deploy a model with the Iris data set to predict the class with highest accuracy possible.

Contents:
	1. Setting up your own environment.
	2. Data Download.
	3. Off to the races!

Chapter 2
Data Download

The data set we'll be using is called the Iris Data Set. It's a simple data set of the measurements of different Iris flowers. This is a classification problem so make sure to use classification models. Download the dataset here(iris.data): https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/

Chapter 3
Off the the races!

Now that you have everything set up. You're ready to use all the knowledge you've gained to create a model to predict the class of an iris flower. Don't be afraid to look back at the Coursera course for a refresher and talk to your peers if you get stuck!

Ex00:
	Expected files: iris_project.py
	The project when completed should show the following:
		- Confusion Matrix
		- Jaccard Index
		- Test set accuracy
	Anything extra is bonus.
