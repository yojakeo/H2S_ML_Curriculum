# H2S Machine Learning Curriculum

This is Machine Learning curriculum I've built for Code For Fun's Hack High School program. This is built to be a project-based introduction to Machine Learning as a whole. The curriculum uses IBM's "Introduction to Machine Learning in Python" via Coursara as the learning material. It is built with peer to peer interaction in mind and uses 42's evaluation system for their grade.

## About the Course

This course uses Coursara as mentioned and currently covers Linear Regression, Non-Linear Regression and K Nearest Neighbors. Each PDF will cover one topic and will be structured so: They learn the material via Coursara using all resources there. Then initialize an environment to create a project to practice and have something to show and tinker with.

### Structure

The first PDF covers Machine Learning basics and work with Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression and Non-Linear Regression. Followed by a Showcase Project with goals for what the project should have using Anaconda as the environment. Lastly they will create a readme in Markdown for documentation with a list of goals.

The second PDF covers K Nearest Neighbors with a Showcase Project with goals for what the project should have.
