Part 1...
----------
Week 1 & week 2 - Roughly 3 Hours of content.

To Do: Watch all videos and take notes for what ML is, What it can do, and the difference between Supervised and Unsupervised learning. for Week 2 they should take notes on what the LR and NLR models do and how to deploy them.

Grading: Show any notes and go to Linear Regression lab and explain in detail what the program's steps are to deploying the model.
